### On screen currency converter
Have you ever looked at a seller's shipping rates and wondered how much they would be in your currency? Have you ever felt annoyed by googling the exchange rate to see what it would actually cost?

The Currency Converter can tell you in an instant!

### Contextual menu
Search Discogs (or many other online shops) instantly with any highlighted text! Simply highlight some text, right click, and choose the shop you want to search. You can configure which shops you want to use by hovering over the "Contextual Menu" option inside Discogs Enhancer. Current selection includes: Bandcamp, Boomkat, Clone, DeeJay, Discogs, Gramaphone, Halcyon, Hardwax, InSound, Juno, Oye and Pacific Beach Vinyl.

### Price suggestion comparisons
This will show the prices that Discogs suggests and compare them to the seller's price in your country's currency. Its useful for seeing if an item is overpriced. If the listed price is within 1% of the suggested price, it will say it's "around the same price". In order for this to work you must be registered as a seller on Discogs. Works for any locale that Discogs supports :)

### Release durations
See total play times for any release that has track time information.

### Better Collection page UI
This makes the Collection page a little more organized and easier to understand. It groups the "Random item" link over with the others on the right. It rearranges the "Move Selected" interface so that it's easier to understand. It more clearly specifies which folder you are currently viewing and colorizes the "Remove Selected" and "Move Selected" buttons. It also disables the "Move Selected" button until a selection has been made. If this description does not make sense go to your collection page and try toggling the option on and off.
