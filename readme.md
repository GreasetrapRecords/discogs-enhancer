### Better Collection page UI
This makes the Collection page a little more organized and easier to understand.

### Block sellers
Ever have a bad experience buying from someone on Discogs? Add their name to the block list and anytime an item of theirs appears in the Marketplace it will be labeled "Blocked seller" so you can decide if it's worth buying from them again. Names can be easily added or removed by clicking on the "Edit list" link within the popup menu and then clicking on the name you want to remove.

The default setting will mark blocked sellers in red while still allowing you to place an order with them. If you select the "Hide sellers" option from the "Edit list" page, blocked sellers will be completely hidden from your search results.

### Buyer/Seller feedback notifications
Now you can get alerts when new feedback is left on your profile. The Feedback Notifier monitors your feedback stats for changes and alerts you when a new one shows up.

### Contextual menu
Search Discogs (or many other online shops) instantly with any highlighted text! Simply highlight some text, right click, and choose the shop you want to search. You can configure which shops you want to use by hovering over the "Contextual Menu" option inside Discogs Enhancer. Current selection includes: Bandcamp, Boomkat, Clone, Decks.de, DeeJay, Discogs, Gramaphone, Halcyon, Hardwax, InSound, Juno, Oye, Pacific Beach Vinyl, Phonica and Sounds of The Universe.

### Feedback Notifications
The Feedback Notifier monitors your feedback stats for changes and alerts you when a new one shows up.

### Filter Marketplace items
This will filter out all items in the Marketplace that are below a specified condition.

For instance, if you select "Near Mint", only Mint and Near Mint condition items will be shown. If you select "Very Good", only Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, and Very Good items will be shown (etc...).

### Highlight release conditions in the Marketplace
Easily see at a glance which items for sale are in the best condition.

### Notes counter
This will count the characters for any "notes" field in your collection/wantlist so you will know when you are getting close to the maximum character limit (255). It can be useful if you like to keep a lot of notes about your collection and you find you frequently run out of space mid-sentence.

### On-screen currency converter
Have you ever looked at a seller's shipping rates and wondered how much they would be in your currency? Have you ever felt annoyed by googling the exchange rate to see what it would actually cost?

The Currency Converter can tell you in an instant!

### Price suggestion comparisons
This will show the prices that Discogs suggests and compare them to the seller's price in your country's currency. Its useful for seeing if an item is overpriced. If the listed price is within 1% of the suggested price, it will say it's "around the same price". In order for this to work you must be registered as a seller on Discogs. Works for any locale that Discogs supports :)
