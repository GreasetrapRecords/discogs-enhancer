### Better Collection page UI
This makes the Collection page a little more organized and easier to understand. It groups the "Random item" link over with the others on the right. It rearranges the "Move Selected" interface so that it's easier to understand. It more clearly specifies which folder you are currently viewing and colorizes the "Remove Selected" and "Move Selected" buttons. It also disables the "Move Selected" button until a selection has been made. If this description does not make sense go to your collection page and try toggling the option on and off.
