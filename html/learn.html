    <!--Block Sellers -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="block_sellers">Block Sellers</h2>
      <p>Ever have a bad experience buying from someone on Discogs? Add their name to the block list and anytime an item of theirs appears in the Marketplace it will be labeled "Blocked seller" so you can decide if it's worth buying from them again.</p>

      <p>Names can be easily added or removed. Simply click "Edit list" on the popup menu and follow the instructions.</p>

      <p>The default setting will mark blocked sellers in red while still allowing you to place an order with them.</p>

      <p>If you select the "Hide sellers everywhere" option from the "Edit list" page, all blocked sellers will be completely hidden from your search results.</p>

      <p>If you select "Hide sellers in the Marketplace", sellers will be hidden in your Marketplace wantlist, but visible and marked in red on an individual release page.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/blocked-seller.jpg" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <!-- contextual menu options -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="contextual-menu">Contextual Menu Options</h2>
      <p>Lets you search Discogs or other online record shops with any text selected on any webpage. Simply highlight some text, right click, and choose the shop you want to search. You can configure which shops you want to use by clicking on the "Contextual Menu" option inside Discogs Enhancer's popup.</p>

      <p>Current selection includes: All Day Records, Bandcamp, Boomkat, Clone, Decks.de, DeeJay, Discogs, Gramaphone, Halcyon, Hardwax, InSound, Juno, Kristina Records, Oye, Pacific Beach Vinyl, Phonica, Sounds Of The Universe and YouTube.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Currency Converter -->
      <h2 id="currency-converter">Currency Converter</h2>
      <p>Have you ever looked at a seller's shipping rates and wondered how much they would be in your currency?</p>

      <p>Now you can quickly find out with the Currency Converter!</p>

      <p><em>Step 1:</em> Click the '¥ € $' button in the lower-right corner of the screen.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/converter-step-1.png" />

      <p><em>Step 2:</em> Choose the seller's currency with the select box labeled <i>'Convert'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/converter-step-2.png" />

      <p><em>Step 3:</em> Then select your currency by choosing an option from the select box labeled <i>'To'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/converter-step-3.png" />

      <p><em>Step 4:</em> Now just type the value into the box and see your results instantly!</p>

      <img src="../img/about/converter-step-4.png" />

      <p>(Price conversions are an estimate and may not match exactly with Discogs' own conversions.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="dark-theme">Dark Theme</h2>
      <p>This makes Discogs much easier on the eyes at night... or all the time. Honestly, after working on this extension, I can't stand looking at Discogs without the dark theme applied.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="everlasting-marketplace">Everlasting Marketplace</h2>

      <p>The Everlasting Marketplace lets you continuously scroll through the Marketplace listings so you'll never have to click "prev" or "next" again!</p>

      <p>More results are automatically loaded once you reach the bottom of the Marketplace listings.</p>

      <p>If you want to change your filter criteria, click the "Add or remove filters" link and you'll be taken to the filters at the top of the page where you can make your adjustments.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/about/everlasting-market-filters.png" />

      <p>Page numbers are inserted between each set of results as you continue to scroll. You can use the "Scroll to" select box to quickly navigate between any previously loaded set of results.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/about/everlasting-market-scroll.png" />

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can stop Everlasting Marketplace from loading more results by clicking the Pause button next to the "Scroll
        to:" select box at the top.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Feedback Notifications -->
      <h2 id="feedback_notifications">Feedback Notifications</h2>
      <p>The Feedback Notifier monitors your feedback stats for changes and alerts you when a new one shows up.</p>

      <p>Notification badges will appear at the top of the page. "S" for
        <i>Seller</i> notifications and "B" for
        <i>Buyer</i> notifications:</p>
      <img src="../img/about/feedback-badges.png" />

      <p>You can dismiss the notification by hovering over the badge and clicking the "X" that appears:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/feedback-dismissal.png" />

      <p>Or you can click on the submenu and go directly to your Positive, Neutral, or Negative feedback pages:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/feedback-hover.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- filter items by condition -->
      <h2 id="hideMarketplace">Filter By Condition</h2>

      <p>This will hide all items in the Marketplace that are below a specified condition.</p>

      <p>For instance, if you select "Near Mint", only
        <i>Mint</i> and <i>Near Mint</i> condition items will be shown. If you select "Very Good", only
        <i>Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, and Very Good</i> items will be shown (etc...).</p>

      <p>When results have been filtered, you will see a note that says "<b>Filtering items below [condition].</b>" next to the pagination links.</p>

      <p>To enable this feature, click on the "Filter By Condition" feature in the popup and select an option from the dropdown that appears.</p>

      <p>To disable this feature, simply select "Disabled" from the select box.</p>

      <p>It's worth noting that this simply hides these items from view. So if there are 25 items per page and 5 of those are hidden, you will only see 20 results on that particular page. Sleeve condition is ignored when filtering items.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- filter items by country -->
      <h2 id="filterByCountry">Filter By Country</h2>

      <p>This will hide all items in the Marketplace that are not from the country specified when using a specific Currency Filter.</p>

      <p>For example, I often search the Marketplace for items in my Wantlist that are listed in US Dollars. Since I live in the US I don't want to buy items in other currencies in order to save on shipping. Some users will list their items in US Dollars even if they are based in another country. By setting the options to "USD" and "United States" in the popup, only items in the United States will be shown as long as I have a Currency Filter set to USD in the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>
        <b>How to use the Filter By Country feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First, select the currency you want to use. It must match the Currency Filter in the Marketplace as this is how Discogs Enhancer knows when to activate this feature.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/about/filter-by-country-1.png" />

      <p>Next, select the country that matches the country of the results you want to see.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/about/filter-by-country-2.png" />

      <p>Finally, turn the option on.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/about/filter-by-country-3.png" />

      <p>As long as the option is enabled, results will be filtered whenever you set a Currency Filter in the Marketplace that matches the currency set in this option.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Fix blurry gallery images -->
      <h2 id="blurry">Fix Blurry Gallery Images</h2>

      <p>If you've ever noticed that some scanned release images have blurry text, this option should fix it.</p>

      <p>This will only work on monitors that are not hi-res so if you use a 4k display or have a Retina screen, you won't see any improvement.</p>

      <p>Please be aware that by enabling this option, you may notice the images "jump" a bit when clicking the zoomed in view. This is a side effect of the way that the extension repositions the images so that they are no longer blurry.</p>

      <p>If you would like a more detailed explaination of how this feature works, please see <a href="https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/759801?page=1#7536285">this post.</a>

    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Hide Min, Median, Max columns -->
      <h2 id="hide-columns">Hide Min, Median, Max Columns</h2>
      <p>This hides the Min, Median, Max columns in the collection page. Helpful if you'd like more space when viewing your collection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Improved Collection UI -->
      <h2 id="improved-ui">Improved Collection UI</h2>
      <p>This makes the Collection page a little more organized and easier to understand.</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Large BAOI Fields -->
      <h2 id="baoi-fields">Large BAOI Fields</h2>
      <p>Makes the <b>Barcodes and Other Identifiers</b> fields larger when you are editing a release. Helpful if you're working with longer texts on a release. (Click on the images below to enlarge them.)
      <br><br>

    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Large YouTube Playlists -->
      <h2 id="youtube-playlists">Large YouTube Playlists</h2>
      <p>Doubles the maximum size of the YouTube playlists on a release or list page. Helpful if there are a lot of videos and you want to be able to see more of them in the playlist at once. Please note: if there are only a few videos on a page, the size of the playlist won't change. You'll only see a larger playlist if there are more than three videos with a maximum of 6 visible at any given time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Marketplace Highlights -->
      <h2 id="highlights">Marketplace Highlights</h2>

      <p>This can make it easier to see what condition items are in by colorizing the Media and Sleeve conditions in the Marketplace with the following colors:</p>

      <ul class="marketplace-highlights">
        <li class="mint">Mint</li>
        <li class="near-mint">Near Mint</li>
        <li class="very-good-plus">Very Good Plus</li>
        <li class="very-good">Very Good</li>
        <li class="good-plus">Good Plus</li>
        <li class="good">Good</li>
        <li class="fair">Fair</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Marketplace Release Ratings -->
      <h2 id="releaseRatings">Marketplace Ratings</h2>

      <p>This will allow you to see the number of votes the release has received within the Marketplace results. If you've ever found yourself browsing another seller's inventory for other items you might want that aren't on your Wantlist, you can use this feature to see a release's rating stat without having to open another page.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/release-rating-link.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>To see ratings, simply click the link that says "Show Ratings". It will be located above the "View Release Page" link on each release listing.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Notes Counter -->
      <h2 id="notesCounter">Notes Counter</h2>

      <p>This will count the characters for any "notes" field in your collection/wantlist so you will know when you are getting close to the maximum character limit (255). It can be useful if you like to keep a lot of notes about your collection and you find you frequently run out of space mid-sentence.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/notes-count.png" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Random Item -->
      <h2 id="randomItem">Random Item Button</h2>

      <p>This will add a &#x267a; button to the nav bar that will show you a random item from your collection when clicked.</p>

      <p>The functionality is identical to the "Random Item" feature in the Collection page but allows you to access it from the nav bar rather than going back to the Collection page and clicking "Random Item" again.</p>

      <p>You have to be logged in for this feature to work.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/random-item-navbar.png" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Release Durations -->
      <h2 id="releaseDurations">Release Durations</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="sort-buttons">Sort Buttons</h2>

      <p>This adds <span class="sort-btn">Sort A-Z</span> buttons on all kinds of things. You can sort the dialog boxes on the Explore page, your personal lists in the 'Add to list' dialog boxes, and any filter within the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The first click sorts A-Z, the second click sorts Z-A and the third click returns the list to its original state (aka undo).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Suggested Prices -->
      <h2 id="suggested-prices">Suggested Prices</h2>

      <p>This will show the prices that Discogs suggests and compare them to the seller's price. It's useful for seeing if an item is priced fairly. <em>In order for this to work you must be registered as a seller.</em></p>

      <p>
        <b>How to use the Suggested Prices feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First choose your currency from the select box. It must be the same currency you use on Discogs:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/prices-step-2.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Next, turn the option on:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/prices-step-3.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>For release pages, the comparisons are displayed automatically.</p>

      <p>For pages like <i>Wantlists,</i> <i>Seller pages</i> or <i>Master Releases</i>, a link is inserted into the page:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/price-link.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Clicking this link will show the comparison for that particular listing:</p>

      <img src="../img/about/price-example.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>Results are displayed in the currency that is set in your seller settings.<i> <em>Because currencies shift due to global market fluctuations and release prices shift due to market demand, the recommended price may differ from the listed price.</em></i> Exchange rate data is calculated every two hours (execpt on weekends when Markets are closed). Discogs uses a different exchange service so their exchange rates might differ slightly from Discogs Enhancers' rates. Use and interpret at your own risk. Please don't use it as an excuse to be a jerk to sellers.</p>

      <p>If you are located outside the US and have any issues, please let me know!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Tag Seller Reputation -->
      <h2 id="reputation">Tag Seller Reputation</h2>

      <p>This will mark any Seller who's reputation is below the percentage specified in the option's submenu. Simply click Tag Seller Reputation, enter a percentage in the box and turn the feature on.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/seller-rep.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>You can also choose one of seven different tag colors.</p>

      <img src="../img/about/seller-rep-tag-color.png" class="max-width" />

      <p><em>Pro Tip:</em> you can use tenths of a percent like: 95.5</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Text Format Shortcuts -->
      <h2 id="text-format-shortcuts">Text Format Shortcuts</h2>

      <p>This adds several buttons to reviews, comments and forum/group reply boxes that allow you to quickly insert <a href="https://www.discogs.com/help/doc/text-formatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">text formatting shortcuts.</a> See a quick demo <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DCAQfeB.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

      <p class="bold short-title">Links</p>

      <p>Quickly add links when writing reviews, notes or forum posts. Simply click on the arrow icon and paste your link into the prompt. It will automatically detect whether the link is a master release, an individual release, a forum post, an artist, a user profile or external website. The link will be formatted and inserted into the textbox at your cursor's current position.</p>

      <p>Links must contain either "http://" or "https://" (e.g.: http://www.google.com) in order to be valid.</p>

      <p class="short-desc"><em>Pro tip:</em> You can also quickly link to a specific <a href="https://www.discogs.com/help/doc/submission-guidelines-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submission guideline</a> by simply typing the guideline number into the prompt (e.g.: 12.2.5).</p>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Tracklist Readability -->
      <h2 id="readability">Tracklist Readability</h2>

      <p>This will insert visual dividers between each side, disc, and/or format of a release in order to make it easier to read. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PQtRpkO.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a short gif to see it in action.</a></p>

      <p>You can show and hide readability dividers by clicking "Show/Hide Dividers" at the top of the track list. Your show/hide preference will be saved each time you change it. </p>

      <img src="../img/about/readability-dividers.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>Please see the <a href="../html/readability.html">Settings page</a> to customize it and for detailed information on how it works.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> There is no single standard when it comes to listing releases with multiple formats and CDs. Because of this, there is no guarantee that the dividers will be correctly inserted for every release. It also depends on data being correctly represented.

Also, it may not work and will likely be unpleasant to read if you are a Javascript enthusiast.
