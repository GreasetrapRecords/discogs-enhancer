      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Thanks for installing Discogs Enhancer!</p>

      <p>This is the “Learn” page. Here you will find in-depth explanations on each feature the extension offers.</p>

      <h3>How To Use It</h3>
      <p>When you are on Discogs.com click on the extension's icon (the small, black record icon) and the extension’s menu will open. There you can place your mouse over the "?" icon on each feature to read a short description of what it does or click the switch on the right to enable/disable the feature. A green switch means the feature is enabled; a gray switch means it is disabled. Once you enable/disable a feature your preference will be saved until you decide to change it.</p>

      <p>Some features have sub-menus with options. These features are identified by the “>” icon before the feature name. Click on the feature name to open up the sub-menu to enable/disable the feature. For features with options it is recommended that you read their description in the "Learn" page to fully understand how they work.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can use the search box in the popup menu to search for keywords like "marketplace", "collection", "profile", etc... and it will only show you features that are designed to work in that particular section of Discogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can click on the "?" icons in the popup menu and go directly to the feature's description here in the Learn page.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Block Sellers -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="blockSellers">Block Sellers</h2>
      <p>Blocks any seller from showing up in the Marketplace or tags them in red and labels them as "Blocked seller". Names can be easily added or removed. Simply click "Edit list" on the popup menu and follow the instructions.</p>

      <p>The <b>Tag Sellers</b> setting (default) will mark blocked sellers in red while still allowing you to place an order with them.</p>

      <p>The <b>Hide sellers everywhere</b> option will hide all blocked sellers throughout the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The <b>Hide sellers in the Marketplace</b> option will hide sellers in your Marketplace Wantlist but they will still be visible and marked in red on an individual release page.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/blocked-seller.png" class="max-width" />
    </div>

    <!-- Collection links in new tabs -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="collectionNewTabs">Collection Links In New Tabs</h2>

      <p>Opens new tabs when clicking on release links in your Collection. <u>Your collection needs to load completely</u> in order for this feature to work properly.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Only works if you have less than 2500 items in your collection.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- contextual menu options -->
    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="contextual-menu">Contextual Menu Options</h2>
      <p>Lets you search Discogs or other online record shops with any text selected on any webpage. Simply highlight some text, right click, and choose the shop you want to search. You can configure which shops you want to use by clicking on the "Contextual Menu" option inside Discogs Enhancer's popup.</p>

      <p>Current selection includes: All Day Records, Bandcamp, Boomkat, Clone, DeeJay, Discogs, Gramaphone, Halcyon, Hardwax, InSound, Juno, Kristina Records, Oye, Pacific Beach Vinyl, Phonica, Rush Hour, Sounds Of The Universe and YouTube.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Currency Converter -->
      <h2 id="currencyConverter">Currency Converter</h2>
      <p>Convert between any of the currencies Discogs supports with the on-screen
        Currency Converter.
      </p>

      <p><em class="white">Step 1:</em> Click the '¥ € $' button in the lower-right corner of the screen.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-1.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 2:</em> Choose the seller's currency with the select box labeled <i>'Convert'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-2.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 3:</em> Then select your currency by choosing an option from the select box labeled <i>'To'</i>.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-3.png" />

      <p><em class="white">Step 4:</em> Now simply type the value into the box and see your results instantly!</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/converter-step-4.png" />

      <p>(Price conversions are an estimate and may not match exactly with Discogs' own conversions.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="darkTheme">Dark Theme</h2>
      <p>This makes Discogs much easier on the eyes at night... or all the time. Completely re-themed from top to bottom!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="everlastingCollection">Everlasting Collection</h2>

      <p>The Everlasting Collection feature lets you continously scroll your Collection without having to click "Prev" or "Next" as long as you are using the "Text With Covers" or "Text Only" layouts.</p>

      <p><b>Please note:</b> this will only work if you have more than 2500 items in your collection. This is because there are two different collection layouts. When you have more than 2500 Discogs switches your collection over to the old collection layout which does not natively support infinite scrolling.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can stop Everlasting Collection from loading more results by clicking the Pause button next to the <i>"Scroll to:"</i> select box at the top of the page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="everlastingMarketplace">Everlasting Marketplace</h2>

      <p>The Everlasting Marketplace lets you continuously scroll through the Marketplace listings.
         More results are automatically loaded once you reach the bottom of the Marketplace listings.</p>

      <p>If you want to change your filter criteria, click the "Add or remove filters" link and you'll be taken to the filters at the top of the page where you can make your adjustments.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/everlasting-market-filters.png" />

      <p>Page numbers are inserted between each set of results as you continue to scroll. You can use the "Scroll to" select box to quickly navigate between any previously loaded set of results.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/everlasting-market-scroll.png" />

      <p>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> You can stop Everlasting Marketplace from loading more results by clicking the Pause button next to the <i>"Scroll to:"</i> select box at the top.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h2 id="favoriteSellers">Favorite Sellers</h2>
      <p>Save your favorite sellers to a list and their name will have a small blue checkmark icon next to it in the Marketplace. Names can be easily added or removed. Simply click "Edit list" on the popup menu and follow the instructions.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/favorite-seller.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Feedback Notifications -->
      <h2 id="feedbackNotifications">Feedback Notifications</h2>
      <p>The Feedback Notifier monitors your feedback stats for changes and alerts you when a new one shows up.</p>

      <p>Notification badges will appear at the top of the page. "S" for
        <i>Seller</i> notifications and "B" for
        <i>Buyer</i> notifications:</p>
      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-badges.png" />

      <p>You can dismiss the notification by hovering over the badge and clicking the "X" that appears:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-dismissal.png" />

      <p>Or you can click on the submenu and go directly to your Positive, Neutral, or Negative feedback pages:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/feedback-hover.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- filter items by country -->
      <h2 id="filterByCountry">Filter By Country</h2>

      <p>This will hide all items in the Marketplace that are not from the country specified when using a specific Currency Filter.</p>

      <p>For example, I often search the Marketplace for items in my Wantlist that are listed in US Dollars. Since I live in the US I don't want to buy items in other currencies in order to save on shipping. Some users will list their items in US Dollars even if they are based in another country. By setting the options to "USD" and "United States" in the popup, only items in the United States will be shown as long as I have a Currency Filter set to USD in the Marketplace.</p>

      <p>
        <b class="no-highlight">How to use the Filter By Country feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First, select the currency you want to use. <b>It must match the Currency Filter in the Marketplace</b> as this is how Discogs Enhancer knows when to activate this feature.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/filter-by-country-1.png" />

      <p>Next, select the country that matches the country of the results you want to see.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/filter-by-country-2.png" />

      <p>Finally, turn the option on.</p>

      <img class="max-width" src="../img/learn/filter-by-country-3.png" />

      <p>As long as the option is enabled, results will be filtered whenever you set a Currency Filter in the Marketplace that matches the currency set in this option.</p>

      <img class="max-height" src="../img/learn/filter-by-country-4.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- filter items by condition -->
      <h2 id="filterMediaCondition">Filter Media Condition</h2>

      <p>Hide all items in the Marketplace that are below a specified condition.</p>

      <p>For example, if you select <i>"Near Mint"</i>, only
        Mint and Near Mint condition items will be shown. If you select "Very Good", only
        Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, and Very Good items will be shown (etc &hellip;).</p>

      <p>When results have been filtered, you will see a note that says <b>Filtering items below [condition]</b> next to the pagination links.</p>

      <p><em>Pro tip:</em>It's worth noting that this simply hides these items from view. So if there are 25 items per page and 5 of those are hidden, you will only see 20 results on that particular page. <i>Sleeve condition is ignored when filtering items.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Fix blurry gallery images -->
      <h2 id="blurry">Fix Blurry Gallery Images</h2>

      <p>If you've ever noticed that some scanned release images have blurry text, this option should fix it.</p>

      <p>This will only work on monitors that are not HD so if you use a 4k display or have a Retina screen, you won't see any improvement.</p>

      <p>Please be aware that by enabling this option, you may notice the images "jump" a bit when clicking the zoomed in view. This is a side effect of the way that the extension repositions the images so that they are no longer blurry.</p>

      <p>If you would like a more detailed explaination of how this feature works, please see <a href="https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/759801?page=1#7536285">this post.</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Hide Min, Median, Max columns -->
      <h2 id="hideColumns">Hide Min, Median, Max Columns</h2>
      <p>This hides the Min, Median, Max columns in the collection page. Helpful if you'd like more space when viewing your collection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Improved Collection UI -->
      <h2 id="improvedUi">Improved Collection UI</h2>
      <p>This makes the Collection page a little more organized by moving some links around and colorizing the Move Selected and Remove Selected buttons. Discogs has since changed the default collection page for most users so this will only work if you have more than 2500 items in your collection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Large BAOI Fields -->
      <h2 id="baoiFields">Large BAOI Fields</h2>
      <p>Makes the <b>Barcodes and Other Identifiers</b> fields larger when you are editing a release. Helpful if you're working with longer texts on a release. (Click on the images below to enlarge them.)

    </div>

    <div class="feature-block">
      <!-- Large YouTube Playlists -->
      <h2 id="youtube-playlists">Large YouTube Playlists</h2>
      <p>Doubles the maximum size of the YouTube playlists on a release or list page. Helpful if there are a lot of videos and you want to be able to see more of them at once.</p>
      <p>Please note: if there are only a few videos on a page, the size of the playlist won't change. You'll only see a larger playlist if there are more than three videos with a maximum of 6 visible at any given time.</p>

      <!-- Marketplace Release Ratings -->
      <h2 id="releaseRatings">Marketplace Ratings</h2>

      <p>Allows you to see the number of votes the release has received within the Marketplace results. If you've ever found yourself browsing another seller's inventory for other items you might want that aren't on your Wantlist, you can use this feature to see a release's rating stat without having to open another page.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/release-rating-link.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>To see ratings, simply click the link that says "Show Ratings". It will be located above the "View Release Page" link on each release listing.</p>

      <p>This will add a "&#x267a;"-shaped button to the nav bar that will show you a random item from your collection when clicked.</p>

      <p>The functionality is identical to the "Random Item" feature in the Collection page but allows you to access it from the nav bar rather than going back to the Collection page and clicking "Random Item" again.</p>

      <p>You have to be logged in for this feature to work.</p>

      <p>This will "scan" a single page of releases and count the number of comments on each release on any Artist or Label page. Think of it as a quick way to get an idea of which releases are being talked about. Once a page has been scanned, release links will open in a new tab/window.</p>

      <p>If there are comments on a release a small gray badge with the number of comments will be appended to the release. If there are no comments, nothing is appended.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/scan-badge.jpg" class="max-width" />

      <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> You can hover over the badge to see the rating and number of votes each releases has received. Clicking the badge will open the release in a new tab.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> Scanning is rate-limited to 1 scan per second in accordance with <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:home,header:home-rate-limiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discogs' rate-limiting rules.</a></p>

      <p>Shows the average price an item has sold for. The average is appened to the bottom of the price history on each release.</p>

      <p>Generally, the average price of an item is close to the <i>Median</i> &mdash; however sometimes there is a sizable difference between the two. This is just another data point to consider when deciding to buy or sell a release.</p>

      <!-- Suggested Prices -->
      <h2 id="suggested-prices">Suggested Prices</h2>

      <p>Shows the prices that Discogs suggests and compares them to the seller's price. It's useful for seeing if an item is priced fairly. <b>In order for this to work you must be registered as a seller.</b></p>

      <p>
        <b class="no-highlight">How to use the Suggested Prices feature:</b>
      </p>

      <p>First choose your currency from the select box. It must be the same currency you use on Discogs:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/prices-step-2.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Next, turn the option on:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/prices-step-3.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>For release pages, the comparisons are displayed automatically.</p>

      <p>For pages like <b>Wantlists,</b> <b>Seller pages,</b> or <b>Master Releases</b>, a link is inserted into the page:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/price-link.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>Clicking this link will show the comparison for that particular listing:</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/price-example.png" class="price-example" />

      <p>Results are displayed in the currency that is set in your Seller settings on Discogs.</p>

      <p><b>Because currencies shift due to global market fluctuations and release prices shift due to market demand, the recommended price may differ from the listed price.</b></p>

      <p>Exchange rate data is calculated every two hours (except on weekends when Markets are closed). Discogs uses a different exchange service so their exchange rates might differ slightly from Discogs Enhancers' rates. Use and interpret at your own risk. Please don't use it as an excuse to be a jerk to sellers.</p>

      <img src="../img/learn/seller-rep.png" class="max-width" />

      <p>You can also choose one of seven different tag colors.</p>

The link will be formatted and inserted into the text box at your cursor's current position.</p>

      <p>Links must contain either "http://" or "https://" <i>(e.g.: https://www.google.com)</i> for it to be recognized as a link.</p>

      <p class="short-desc"><em>Pro tip:</em> You can also quickly link to a specific <a href="https://www.discogs.com/help/doc/submission-guidelines-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submission guideline</a> by simply typing the guideline number into the prompt <i>(e.g.: 12.2.5)</i>.</p>
